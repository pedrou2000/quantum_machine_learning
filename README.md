# Quantum-Assisted Generative Models: A Comparative Study on Performance and Potential Improvements in GANs and BMs
This thesis, serving as my Computer Science Bachelor's thesis, explores the potential benefits of employing quantum-assisted algorithms in 
generative models, with a primary focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Boltzmann Machines (BMs). By comparing the performance of classical
and quantum-assisted algorithms, we aim to obtain a deeper understanding of their respective strengths and limitations, paving the way for potential 
improvements. The research began with an extensive literature review, identifying two main quantum-assisted generative algorithms employed in GANs and 
BMs. We then conducted an initial study examining the capability of GANs and BMs to learn simple one-dimensional distributions.

Subsequently, a quantum-annealer-assisted Restricted and Limited Boltzmann Machine was implemented using the D-Wave quantum computer for the experiments. 
The quantum-assisted GAN is planned to be implemented and improved in the next phase of this research. This thesis contributes to the broader fields of
machine learning and artificial intelligence by exploring potential performance enhancements offered by quantum computing. These insights could have 
significant implications for the future development of machine learning technologies, particularly in the context of generative models, which could 
ultimately lead to more stable, efficient, and diverse data generation.
